webcam live streaming system whether Freaking HOchacha is working or not

## Features what I want to add
- Video Streaming
- Secure Communication with Enanbling TLS
  - make some PKI System for trusting between device
- Some of Network Tricking -> forwarding video stream from edge device to AWS VPC
  - http://hochacha.com/isworking -> this link could be main page for monitoring video
  - This requires some upgrades current webpage hosting.
  - maybe change web server into nginx. (currently springboot, hard to maintain and lots of overhead to build binary)
- AI recognition for monitoring behavior whether he is concentrating or not
  - some Fancy-ai processing would be applied on edge device or web server (but, processing in web server charges bill)
- spine keeper
## Dependency
- FFmpeg
- nginx
## Hosting Infrastructure
- Maybe baremetal device
  - One for lab, One for home
- edge device
  - android phone and raspi (may be just do raspi first)
  - after raspi, make some android app
